When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
	When I want to push changes from another computer, or when I want to share my files and colaborate with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because I want to be sure that code has no bugs when I decide to pull it on GitHub

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    
    I use branches when I want to add changes in
    the same repository. When I want to copy repository I can Fork it (when I want to copy it on GitHub from one to another location) and clone it (when I want to copy it from GitHub to local computer or on local computer from one place to another)
    
    I would use forking when I want to makes changes public, and cloning when I want to make changes locally. 
      

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    We can allways see what the remote version is even when we are not online, we can make changes and merge them when we want and push them to remote repository when we are online.
